## [Getting Started](#compiling-multiple-scripts)
Head over to the [Discord BOT Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=842340656831135754&permissions=0&scope=bot), there you need to select a server from your account and then click on **Authorize**. Then you will see the MARK-I (current version) is added to your discord server. The BOT will be initially offline in the server like this:

This is because currently the BOT is not deployed on any platform, so it will not work as soon as you add it to your server. To make the BOT come online, we need to follow certain steps first:
1. Eitherd download my code or firstly Fork my Repo and open up a terminal and type the following command
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dakshsethi/MARK-BOT.git
  ```
